# **What is Java** ?

`Java` is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere `(WORA)`, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any `Java virtual machine` (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to `C` and `C++`, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

## Sample Java Code

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, This is Java !");
    }
}
```

## To Compile and Run This Program

```bash
$ javac main.java
```

## To run
```bash
$ java main
```

## History

Java is a **popular**, high-level, and widely-used programming language. It was developed by James Gosling and released by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in 1995.

<details>
    <summary><strong>Key Characteristics</strong></summary>

- **Platform Independence**: Java uses a "write once, run anywhere" approach. Code written in Java can be executed on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without modification. This is achieved through the compilation of Java source code into bytecode, which is interpreted by the JVM on the target platform.

- **Object-Oriented**: Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it focuses on the use of objects and classes to structure and design software.

- **Robust**: Java is designed to be a robust language with features like strong typing, automatic memory management (garbage collection), and exception handling, which helps in producing reliable and stable software.

- **Secure**: Java has built-in security features, including a secure execution environment within the JVM that helps prevent unauthorized access and execution of malicious code.

- **Multi-Threaded**: Java has built-in support for multithreading, which allows developers to create concurrent and parallel applications easily.

- **Rich Standard Library**: Java comes with a rich standard library (Java Standard Library or Java API) that provides pre-built classes and methods for common tasks such as file handling, networking, and data structures.

- **Community and Ecosystem**: Java has a vast and active developer community. It has a wide range of libraries, frameworks, and tools that make it suitable for various application domains, including web development, mobile app development (Android), enterprise software, and more.

- **Portability**: Java's platform independence and "write once, run anywhere" principle make it an excellent choice for cross-platform software development.

- **Popular for Enterprise Applications**: Java is commonly used in enterprise-level applications, such as web applications, server-side applications, and large-scale systems.

- **Open-Source Implementation**: There are open-source implementations of the Java platform, such as OpenJDK, in addition to Oracle's official implementation.

Java is commonly used in a wide range of applications, including web development (Java EE, Spring), mobile app development (Android), scientific and financial applications, game development, and more. Its versatility and broad adoption have contributed to its enduring popularity in the software development community.
